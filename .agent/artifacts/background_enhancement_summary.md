# Background Animation Enhancement

## Status: Completed

### Changes Implemented
1.  **Increased Visibility & Contrast**:
    -   Changed particle color to a bright Cyan (`rgba(6, 182, 212, 0.9)`).
    -   Increased particle opacity from `0.5` to `0.9`.
    -   Removed the `opacity-60` class from the canvas element, setting it to `opacity-100`.

2.  **"Electric" Effect**:
    -   Added a glow effect using `shadowBlur` and `shadowColor`.
    -   Increased particle speed from `0.5` to `1.2` for more dynamic movement.
    -   Changed mouse interaction color to a bright Electric Purple (`rgba(168, 85, 247, 0.8)`).

3.  **Density**:
    -   Increased particle count from `60` to `100`.
    -   Increased connection distance slightly to maintain network effect with higher speed.

### Verification
-   Verified visually via browser screenshot (`landing_page_animation_1764856479711.png`).
